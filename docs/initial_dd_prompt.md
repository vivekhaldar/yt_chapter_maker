use this product spec to write a detailed engineering design doc. this should be detailed and unambiguous enough that it can be handed over to a junior software engineer for implementation.

basic technology choices:
- use python
- use uv for project and dependency management
- run on command line (no need for gui)
- use gpt-4o as the LLM, I will provide key in the usual env var


The file should be in markdown format, and live in docs/design_doc.md
